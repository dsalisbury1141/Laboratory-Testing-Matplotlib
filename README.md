# Matplotlib-Challenge


This exercise was extremely challenging, (I know I say that every time) but it appears I need to relearn all the material each exercise I am tasked with.

Observations:

1. I am learning that when I am about to give up I find the solutions or am offered help by the amazing tutors and BCS and TA's I big thank you!!
2. I learned that I need a lot more practice with Scatter plots
3. I released that if I was talked with this in a real world scenario that I would have used a lot more data than provided, I do not feel that the outliers are actuate based on
